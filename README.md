# City Distance Calculator

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **arrays, classes, and libraries** in C++.  
The program allows a user to store city information (name + coordinates) and calculate the distance between two cities on a 2D map.

## Features
- Menu-driven interface:
  1. Enter City Information  
  2. Calculate Distance Between Two Cities  
  3. Print All Cities  
  4. Quit  
- Each city has:
  - A **name** (supports spaces, e.g., *New York*)  
  - **Coordinates** `(x, y)` relative to the origin `(0,0)`  
- Calculates distances using the **Euclidean distance formula**  
- Prevents the user from choosing the same city twice  
- If the city list is full, the user may overwrite an existing entry
