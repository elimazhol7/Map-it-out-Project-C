Project Title: City Distance Calculator
Course: CSC122
Student Name: Elima Zholdubaeva

~ Purpose of the Program
This program allows the user to calculate distances between cities on a 2D map. 
Each city has a name and coordinates relative to an origin (0,0). The system stores cities, prints them, and calculates distances. 
It also demonstrates the use of arrays, classes, and separate libraries in C++.

~ Features
Menu-driven interface with four options:
Enter City Information
Calculate Distance Between Two Cities
Print All Cities
Quit
Cities have both a name (supports spaces, e.g., New York) and coordinates (x, y).
Distances are calculated using the Euclidean distance formula.
Prevents selecting the same city for distance calculations.
If the city list is full, the user can choose to overwrite an existing city.
Works with both number or letter menu input (e.g., 1 or E for Enter).
